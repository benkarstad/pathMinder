/**
 * A special ItemGroup linked to a Character. Each character has one, and only one, inventory.
 * A character's inventory represents the entirety of what a character has on their person in a given moment.
 * Anything in a character's inventory moves with them and affects their movement through Encumbrance.
 * Unlike most containers, an Inventory's capacity isn't fixed and is dictated by the players strength;
 * for example, if a character is already overencumbered and their strength is reduced,
 * they will collapse, unable to move without shedding some equipment.
