 * A physical item. Items have a number of attributes; some, like their weight, can be easily determined by empirical means.
 * Others, like their gold value and true identity may be more difficult to discern;
 * A certain player may not know what an item is, or may have incorrect/inaccurate information.
 * <p>
 * Calling no-argument get methods only reveals immediately apparent information, like weight.
 * Other, possibly hidden, aspects may require providing the identity of the observing character to glean more.
 * <p>
 * Identifying items is an integral part of the narrative.
 * This feature allows the DM to hold finer control over what the party knows,
 * while still providing the full features of pathMinder's inventory system.
